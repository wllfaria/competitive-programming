This folder contains all problems related to competitive programming, the folders inside this folder follow a naming pattern that is described below:

## Folder naming pattern

Every folder inside this folder will be following the same pattern, which divides the name of the folder in 3 chunks. A `source`, `name` and `difficulty` i.e:

```
codeforces-watermelon-easy
```

The difficulties can be one of the following:

* Very easy - If the problem was not even challenging.
* Easy - If i managed to solve it without many problems.
* Medium - If the problem was challenging but I managed to solve it.
* Hard - If I managed to solve it but struggled on the way.
* Very hard - If I managed to solve and struggled or needed external research.
* Impossible - If I failed to resolve the problem.

> Note: the written difficulty is based on the time of the conclusion of the problem, inside the problem folder will also be a readme containing dates of revisions if there are any and also a new difficulty score based on the time I revised.
