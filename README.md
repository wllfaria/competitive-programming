# Competitive Programming

This repository holds all the problems and practices I've been doing to learn competitive programming. It also holds every good resource I've found, guides that I'll be following and the ones I make myself in the future. It also have a huge list of topics to be studied in the projects section.

## Resources

This section contains links to practice and learning resources.

* [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
    * Code forces is a competitive programming website that has dozens of free exercises to practice.
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
    * Hackerrank is almost the same as Code forces, but it also have dozens of tutorials about basic principles. this is what I used to practice the principles of C++ language.
* [Errichto guide on how to practice](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/wiki/How-to-practice%3F)
    * This is a comprehensive guide made by Errichto in regards of how to properly practice for competitive programming. I plan onto creating my own guides once I feel more confortable.
* [Competitive Programming Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
    * The most complete book about competitive programming I've found, I would consider this a must read.
* [Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/)
    * This is a massive list of interview topics to study if the goal is to get a job at FAANG
* [Errichto's list of learning resources](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/wiki/Learning-resources)
    * This is the list of learning resources created by Errichto.

## Study Topics

There is a board in the projects section that contain a huge list of topics sorted by category, difficulty and wheter it is important, feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/wllfaria/competitive-programming/projects).

## Disclaimers

1. Although this repository is named competitive programming, it is a great resource to learn and practice for coding interviews and/or just to get better at solving problems and algorithms.
2. Most of competitive programmers tend to use C++ as their main language, this happens by the fact that C++ have a lot of data structures and it is also one of the most performatic programming languages out there. That beign said, you don't need to learn C++ to practice, learn and overall get better at algorithms, data structures and so on. If  you already know a programming language or just don't like C++, you can just go ahead with any other. But if you don't know any languages yet, then you can start with C++.
